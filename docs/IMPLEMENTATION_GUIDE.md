# Implementation Guide: Predicting Employee Tenure, Attrition, and Promotion Time with GPT-OSS-120B

## 1. Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for building a sophisticated employee analytics platform using OpenAI's open-source 120-billion-parameter model, `gpt-oss-120b`. Traditional machine learning models have long been used for predicting employee attrition and tenure, but recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly outperform them. A 2024 study, "Can Large Language Model Predict Employee Attrition?" [1], found that a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model achieved an F1-score of 0.92, a 10-point improvement over the best traditional models. This is because LLMs can understand the complex, nuanced relationships within employee data that other models miss.

By leveraging the power of `gpt-oss-120b` on your two NVIDIA DGX Spark systems, you can build a predictive model that is not only more accurate but also more interpretable, providing clear, human-readable reasoning for its predictions.

### Key Advantages of Using `gpt-oss-120b`

*   **Higher Accuracy**: Proven to outperform traditional models in attrition prediction.
*   **Multi-Task Learning**: A single model can predict tenure, attrition, and promotion time.
*   **Interpretability**: The model can explain its predictions in natural language.
*   **Personalization**: The model can be adapted to provide personalized predictions based on an individual's history.

## 2. Solution Architecture

The proposed solution follows a three-stage process: data preparation, model fine-tuning, and inference with personalization.

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **1. Data Preparation** | Your structured employee data (CSV, database) will be converted into a text-based, instruction-following format (JSONL) suitable for fine-tuning the LLM. |
| **2. Model Fine-Tuning** | The `gpt-oss-120b` model will be fine-tuned on your prepared dataset using your two DGX Spark systems for distributed training. This will create a specialized model that understands the nuances of your organization's employee data. |
| **3. Inference & Personalization** | The fine-tuned model will be used to make predictions. A two-stage approach will be used to provide both population-level and personalized predictions. |

This architecture is designed to be deployed on your two DGX Spark systems, taking full advantage of their combined computational power for both fine-tuning and inference.



## 3. Data Preparation

The most critical step in this process is converting your structured employee data into a format that the LLM can understand. We will use an instruction-following format, where each data point becomes a conversation with the model. This teaches the model to act as an HR analytics expert.

### 3.1. Input Data

Your input data should be a CSV file or database table with the following columns:

*   `hire_date`
*   `promotion_date` (can be null)
*   `title`
*   `department`
*   `region`
*   `performance_rating` (e.g., "Meets Expectations", "Exceeds Expectations")
*   `actual_tenure` (for historical data)
*   `attrition` (True/False, for historical data)

### 3.2. Output Format: JSONL

We will convert each row of your data into a JSON object, with each object representing a single training example. These objects will be stored in a JSONL file (one JSON object per line).

Here is an example of a single training example:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an HR analytics expert. Predict employee tenure, promotion time, and attrition risk based on employee profiles."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Employee Profile:\n- Hire Date: 2020-01-15\n- Title: Senior Engineer\n- Department: Engineering\n- Region: North America\n- Last Promotion: 2022-03-20\n- Performance: High\n\nPredict: 1) Expected tenure in current role, 2) Time to next promotion, 3) Attrition risk"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Based on this profile:\n\n1. Expected Tenure: 2.8 years\n   Reasoning: High performer in Engineering with recent promotion shows career progression. Typical tenure for this level is 2-3 years before next move.\n\n2. Time to Next Promotion: 1.5 years\n   Reasoning: 2-year gap between last promotion suggests 18-month promotion cycle. High performance accelerates timeline.\n\n3. Attrition Risk: Low (15%)\n   Reasoning: Recent promotion, high performance, and career progression indicate strong engagement. Engineering retention is typically high for promoted employees."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.3. Data Conversion Script

I will provide a Python script to automate this conversion. The script will read your CSV file, generate the JSONL file, and split it into training and validation sets.



## 4. Model Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting the pre-trained `gpt-oss-120b` model to your specific task and data. This will create a specialized model that is an expert in your company's employee dynamics. We will use your two DGX Spark systems to perform distributed training, which is necessary for a model of this size.

### 4.1. Hardware Setup

Your two DGX Spark systems provide a combined 256 GB of unified memory, which is sufficient for fine-tuning the 120B parameter model. The key is to leverage the high-speed 200 Gbps QSFP interconnects for efficient communication between the two nodes.

*   **DGX Spark 1 (Master Node)**: Will run the master process for distributed training.
*   **DGX Spark 2 (Worker Node)**: Will run the worker process.

Ensure the two systems are connected via the QSFP ports and have static IP addresses assigned (e.g., `192.168.1.1` and `192.168.1.2`).

### 4.2. Fine-Tuning Script

The `gpt-oss` GitHub repository provides scripts for fine-tuning. We will adapt these for a distributed setup using PyTorch's `torchrun`.

Below is the command to launch the fine-tuning job. You will run this command on both DGX Spark systems, with `node_rank` set to `0` on the master and `1` on the worker.

**On DGX Spark 1 (Master Node):**

```bash
torchrun \
    --nproc_per_node=1 \
    --nnodes=2 \
    --node_rank=0 \
    --master_addr="192.168.1.1" \
    --master_port=12355 \
    finetune.py \
    --model_name_or_path openai/gpt-oss-120b \
    --train_data_file path/to/your/train_data.jsonl \
    --validation_data_file path/to/your/validation_data.jsonl \
    --output_dir ./employee_analytics_model \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5
```

**On DGX Spark 2 (Worker Node):**

```bash
torchrun \
    --nproc_per_node=1 \
    --nnodes=2 \
    --node_rank=1 \
    --master_addr="192.168.1.1" \
    --master_port=12355 \
    finetune.py \
    --model_name_or_path openai/gpt-oss-120b \
    --train_data_file path/to/your/train_data.jsonl \
    --validation_data_file path/to/your/validation_data.jsonl \
    --output_dir ./employee_analytics_model \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5
```

### 4.3. Key Parameters

*   `--model_name_or_path`: Specifies the base model to fine-tune (`gpt-oss-120b`).
*   `--train_data_file`: Path to your training JSONL file.
*   `--output_dir`: Where to save the fine-tuned model.
*   `--num_train_epochs`: The number of times to iterate over the training data (3 is a good starting point).
*   `--per_device_train_batch_size`: How many training examples to process at once on each DGX Spark.
*   `--learning_rate`: Controls how much the model's weights are adjusted during training.



## 5. Inference and Personalization

Once your model is fine-tuned, you can use it to make predictions. A key part of your request was to provide both population-level and personalized predictions. We will achieve this with a two-stage inference process.

### 5.1. Stage 1: Population-Level Prediction

First, we get a baseline prediction from the fine-tuned model based on the employee's general profile.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the fine-tuned model on a single DGX Spark
model_path = "./employee_analytics_model"
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_path,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
)

def get_population_prediction(employee_profile):
    prompt = f"""Employee Profile:\n{employee_profile}\n\nPredict: 1) Expected tenure in current role, 2) Time to next promotion, 3) Attrition risk"""
    
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an HR analytics expert."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
    
    outputs = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=512)
    return outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]

# Example usage
new_employee = {
    "Hire Date": "2023-01-10",
    "Title": "Software Engineer",
    "Department": "Technology",
    "Region": "West Coast",
    "Last Promotion": "N/A",
    "Performance": "Meets Expectations"
}

profile_text = "\n".join([f"- {k}: {v}" for k, v in new_employee.items()])

base_prediction = get_population_prediction(profile_text)
print(base_prediction)
```

### 5.2. Stage 2: Personalization

Next, we take the baseline prediction and ask the model to refine it based on the individual's specific history. This allows the model to account for nuances that are unique to that person.

```python
def get_personalized_prediction(base_prediction, individual_history):
    personalization_prompt = f"""
The population-level prediction for this employee is:\n{base_prediction}\n
Now, consider this individual's specific history:\n{individual_history}\n
Adjust the prediction based on this new information. Provide a personalized prediction with updated reasoning."""

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an HR analytics expert."},
        {"role": "user", "content": personalization_prompt}
    ]

    outputs = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=512)
    return outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]

# Example usage
history = {
    "Actual tenure so far": "1.5 years",
    "Project completion rate": "95%",
    "Manager feedback": "Exceeds expectations in technical skills, needs development in leadership.",
    "Engagement survey score": "85/100"
}

history_text = "\n".join([f"- {k}: {v}" for k, v in history.items()])

personalized_prediction = get_personalized_prediction(base_prediction, history_text)
print(personalized_prediction)
```

This two-stage approach allows you to provide both a general benchmark and a highly specific, personalized forecast for each employee, as you can also use this to provide a confidence score for the prediction.



## 6. Deployment on DGX Spark Systems

Your two NVIDIA DGX Spark systems are the ideal platform for this project, providing the necessary computational power for both fine-tuning and inference. Here’s a more detailed look at the deployment process.

### 6.1. System Requirements

*   **GPU Memory**: `gpt-oss-120b` with MXFP4 quantization requires approximately 80 GB of GPU memory for inference. Your DGX Spark systems, each with 128 GB of unified memory, are well-equipped for this.
*   **Storage**: You will need sufficient storage for the model weights (~240 GB for BF16), your dataset, and the fine-tuned model checkpoints.
*   **Networking**: The 200 Gbps QSFP interconnect is crucial for efficient distributed training. Ensure this is properly configured.

### 6.2. Software Environment

It is recommended to use a containerized environment (like Docker or Apptainer) to manage dependencies. Your container should include:

*   **PyTorch**: A recent version with CUDA support.
*   **Transformers**: The Hugging Face Transformers library.
*   **vLLM**: For optimized inference.
*   **NCCL**: For distributed communication.
*   **CUDA Toolkit**: Aligned with your PyTorch version.

### 6.3. Monitoring

During fine-tuning and inference, it is important to monitor the performance of your DGX Spark systems. Use tools like `nvidia-smi` and `nvtop` to monitor GPU utilization, memory usage, and temperature.

## 7. Docker Deployment (Recommended for DGX Spark)

For a robust and reproducible environment on your DGX Spark systems, using Docker is highly recommended. The repository now includes a `Dockerfile`.

### 7.1. Building the Docker Image

On one of your DGX Spark systems (or any machine with Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed), navigate to the repository root and build the image:

```bash
# Ensure you are logged into the NVIDIA NGC registry if using a private base image
# docker login nvcr.io

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gpt-oss-analytics:latest .
```

### 7.2. Running the Distributed Fine-Tuning Job with Docker

The fine-tuning process requires two containers to communicate across the network. You must run the container with network host mode and mount the necessary volumes.

**Prerequisites:**
1.  Ensure both DGX Spark systems have the `gpt-oss-analytics:latest` image.
2.  The data (`data/train_dataset.jsonl`, etc.) must be accessible to both containers (e.g., mounted from a shared network drive or copied locally).

**On DGX Spark 1 (Master Node):**

```bash
docker run --gpus all --network host --ipc=host \
    -v /path/to/your/repo/data:/app/data \
    -v /path/to/your/repo/employee_analytics_model:/app/employee_analytics_model \
    gpt-oss-analytics:latest \
    /bin/bash -c "chmod +x scripts/launch_distributed_training.sh && scripts/launch_distributed_training.sh 0 <IP_ADDRESS_OF_SPARK_1>"
```

**On DGX Spark 2 (Worker Node):**

```bash
docker run --gpus all --network host --ipc=host \
    -v /path/to/your/repo/data:/app/data \
    -v /path/to/your/repo/employee_analytics_model:/app/employee_analytics_model \
    gpt-oss-analytics:latest \
    /bin/bash -c "chmod +x scripts/launch_distributed_training.sh && scripts/launch_distributed_training.sh 1 <IP_ADDRESS_OF_SPARK_1>"
```

*Note: Replace `/path/to/your/repo/...` with the actual absolute path on your host machines.*

### 7.3. Running Inference with Docker

For inference, you only need to run the container on a single DGX Spark:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --network host --ipc=host \
    -v /path/to/your/repo/employee_analytics_model:/app/employee_analytics_model \
    gpt-oss-analytics:latest \
    python3 examples/inference_two_stage.py
```
