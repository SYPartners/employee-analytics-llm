# Using LLMs for Structured Data: Approaches for Employee Analytics

## Three Main Approaches for LLMs with Structured Data

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Best for**: Filtering and finding specific records

**How it works**:
- Convert employee records to embeddings using an embedding model
- Store embeddings in a vector database
- Query with natural language to retrieve similar records
- LLM uses retrieved records as context to answer questions

**Example use case**: "Find all employees in Engineering who were promoted within 2 years"

**Limitations**: 
- Not suitable for aggregate statistics or predictions across entire dataset
- Works best for finding and filtering specific records

### 2. Code Generation
**Best for**: Complex queries, statistics, and aggregate operations

**How it works**:
- Provide LLM with sample data structure (first 5-10 rows)
- LLM generates Python/Pandas code to perform the analysis
- Code is executed to produce results

**Example use case**: "Calculate average tenure by department and title level"

**Tools**: LangChain's `create_pandas_dataframe_agent`

**Security consideration**: Generated code is executed automatically - requires careful permission management

### 3. Synthetic Data Generation
**Best for**: Creating training data, augmentation, testing

**How it works**:
- LLM generates new data points with similar characteristics to existing data
- Can specify types and statistical properties

**Example use case**: Generate synthetic employee records for testing promotion prediction models

## Application to Employee Analytics Problem

### The Challenge
The user wants to predict:
1. Average tenure in role
2. Attrition risk
3. Average promotion time

With both population-level and personalized predictions.

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

#### Option 1: LLM as Feature Engineer + Traditional ML
```
1. Use GPT-OSS-120B to extract features from employee data
   - Convert structured data to text descriptions
   - Use LLM to identify patterns and generate derived features
   - Extract semantic features from job titles, departments

2. Train traditional ML models on LLM-generated features
   - XGBoost/LightGBM for predictions
   - Survival analysis for attrition
   - Regression for tenure and promotion time

3. Personalization layer
   - Use individual history to adjust predictions
   - Fine-tune on person-specific data
```

#### Option 2: Few-Shot Learning with GPT-OSS-120B
```
1. Format employee data as natural language
   Example: "Employee hired on 2020-01-15 in Engineering as Senior Engineer 
   in North America region. Promoted to Staff Engineer on 2022-03-20."

2. Provide examples in prompt (few-shot learning)
   - Include 5-10 examples of employees with known outcomes
   - Show patterns of tenure, promotion, attrition

3. Query for predictions
   "Given this employee profile, predict:
   - Expected tenure in current role
   - Promotion timeline
   - Attrition risk"

4. Use chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Set reasoning level to "high" for complex predictions
   - Access full reasoning process for interpretability
```

#### Option 3: Code Generation for Analytics
```
1. Load employee dataset as Pandas DataFrame

2. Use GPT-OSS-120B with code generation
   - Generate Python code for statistical analysis
   - Create survival curves for attrition
   - Build regression models programmatically

3. Iterative refinement
   - LLM generates analysis code
   - Execute and review results
   - Refine queries for better insights
```

## Implementation Strategy for DGX Spark

### Memory Requirements
- GPT-OSS-120B with MXFP4: ~80GB
- Single DGX Spark (128GB): Sufficient for inference
- Two DGX Sparks (256GB): Can handle fine-tuning

### Recommended Workflow

**Phase 1: Baseline with Code Generation**
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_experimental.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
import pandas as pd

# Load employee data
df = pd.read_csv("employee_data.csv")

# Initialize GPT-OSS-120B (via API or local deployment)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-oss-120b")

# Create agent for data analysis
agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
    llm, df,
    agent_type="tool-calling",
    verbose=True,
    allow_dangerous_code=True
)

# Query for insights
response = agent.invoke(
    "Calculate average tenure by department and identify factors "
    "correlated with early attrition"
)
```

**Phase 2: Few-Shot Prediction**
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load model on DGX Spark
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
)

# Format employee data as text
def format_employee(row):
    return f"""Employee Profile:
    - Hire Date: {row['hire_date']}
    - Current Title: {row['title']}
    - Department: {row['department']}
    - Region: {row['region']}
    - Last Promotion: {row['last_promotion_date']}
    - Performance Rating: {row['performance']}
    """

# Create few-shot prompt with examples
prompt = """You are an HR analytics expert. Based on historical employee data, 
predict tenure, promotion time, and attrition risk.

Example 1: [employee profile] → Tenure: 3.2 years, Promotion: 2.1 years, Attrition Risk: Low
Example 2: [employee profile] → Tenure: 1.8 years, Promotion: N/A, Attrition Risk: High
...

Now predict for this employee:
{new_employee_profile}

Provide predictions with reasoning."""

# Generate predictions
outputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=512)
```

**Phase 3: Fine-Tuning for Personalization**
```python
# Fine-tune GPT-OSS-120B on employee data
# Requires distributed training across two DGX Sparks

# Format training data as instruction-following examples
training_data = [
    {
        "instruction": "Predict tenure and attrition for this employee",
        "input": format_employee(row),
        "output": f"Tenure: {row['actual_tenure']}, Attrition: {row['attrition']}"
    }
    for row in historical_data
]

# Use LoRA or QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning
# Deploy across two DGX Sparks with PyTorch DDP
```

## Advantages of LLM Approach

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Query data without writing SQL or code
2. **Interpretability**: Chain-of-thought reasoning explains predictions
3. **Flexibility**: Easily adapt to new questions without retraining
4. **Feature Engineering**: Automatic extraction of semantic features
5. **Personalization**: Few-shot learning adapts to individual patterns

## Limitations

1. **Computational Cost**: Running 120B model requires significant resources
2. **Latency**: Slower than traditional ML models for predictions
3. **Accuracy**: May not match specialized models for simple regression tasks
4. **Consistency**: LLM outputs can vary between runs
5. **Data Privacy**: Sending employee data to external APIs raises concerns

## Recommendation

**Start with Hybrid Approach**:
1. Use GPT-OSS-120B for exploratory analysis and feature engineering
2. Generate insights and code for statistical analysis
3. Build traditional ML models (XGBoost, survival analysis) for production predictions
4. Use LLM for interpretability and explaining predictions to stakeholders

**Scale to Full LLM if needed**:
- If interpretability and flexibility outweigh speed concerns
- If you need to handle diverse, ad-hoc queries
- If you can fine-tune on your specific employee data
